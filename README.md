# CH47-no-scientists-bug-fix
Rust (game) Oxide plugin fixing CH47 (Chinook) spawned with no scientists

On some Rust maps (modded with Oxide) CH47 spawns out of liveable map and all scientists die immediately. This plugin can fix this issue partially. 

If CH47 spawned out of liveable area then the plugin kills the object and creates new one just on the map borders. 

This patch shouldn't affect Oil Rig event (with heave scientits) as this CH47 spawns in livable area.

Don't hesitate to continue with this project
